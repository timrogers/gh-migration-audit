# gh-migration-audit


A [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) [extension](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_extension) for auditing GitHub repositories to highlight data that cannot be automatically migrated using [GitHub's migration tools](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/overview/migration-paths-to-github)

You can use this tool to identify data that will be lost, or which you'll need to migrate manually, when migrating:

* from GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) to GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC)
* from GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC) to GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)
* between tenants on GitHub.com (e.g. from a normal GitHub.com account to an [Enterprise Managed Users](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/about-enterprise-managed-users) organization)

The results from audits with this tool are non-exhaustive - they won't identify every possible kind of data loss from a migration - but the goal is to get you 95% of the way there.

## What unmigratable data can this tool detect?

- Git LFS objects
- Repository Actions secrets
- Repository Actions variables
- Repository Codespaces secrets
- Repisitory Dependabot secrets
- Repository discussions
- Repository rulesets
- Repository webhooks
- Stars

## Installation 

Make sure you've got the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed. If you haven't, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation).

Once `gh` is ready and available on your machine, you can install this extension by running `gh extension install timrogers/gh-migration-audit`.

You can check that the extension is installed and working by running `gh migration-audit --help`.

## Usage

### Audit a single repo

`gh migration-audit audit-repo` will audit a single GitHub repository and output a CSV file with information about data that cannot be migrated automatically.

You'll need an access token token with appropriate permissions. The extension won't use your existing login session for the GitHub CLI. You'll need a classic token with the `repo` scope, [authorized for SSO](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on) if applicable.

You can audit a repo like this:

```bash
gh migration-audit audit-repo \
    # A GitHub access token with the permissions described above. This can also be configured using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
    --access-token GITHUB_TOKEN \
    # The login of the user or organization that owns the repository
    --owner monalisa \
    # The name of the repository
    --repo octocat \
    # OPTIONAL: The path to write the audit result CSV to. Defaults to the specified owner and repo, followed by the current date and time, e.g. `monalisa_octocat_1698925405325.csv
    --output-path octocat.csv \
    # OPTIONAL: The base URL of the GitHub API, if you're migrating from a migration source other than GitHub.com.
    --base-url https://github.acme.inc/api/v3
    # OPTIONAL: The URL of an HTTP(S) proxy to use for requests to the GitHub API (e.g. `http://localhost:3128`). This can also be set using the PROXY_URL environment variable.
    --proxy-url https://10.0.0.1:3128
```

The tool will audit your repo, and then write a CSV file to the `--output-path` with the results.

### Audit all repos owned by an organization or user

`gh migration-audit audit-all` will audit all GitHub repositories owned by a specific organization or user, and output a CSV file with information about data that cannot be migrated automatically.

You can run the command like this:

```bash
gh migration-audit audit-all \
    # A GitHub access token with the permissions described above. This can also be configured using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
    --access-token GITHUB_TOKEN \
    # The login of the user or organization that owns the repositories.
    --owner monalisa \
    # The type of the owner of the repositories - either `user` or `organization`.
    --owner-type user \
    # OPTIONAL: The path to write the audit result CSV to. Defaults to the specified owner followed by the current date and time, e.g. `monalisa_1698925405325.csv`.
    --output-path octocat.csv \
    # OPTIONAL: The base URL of the GitHub API, if you're migrating from a migration source other than GitHub.com.
    --base-url https://github.acme.inc/api/v3
    # OPTIONAL: The URL of an HTTP(S) proxy to use for requests to the GitHub API (e.g. `http://localhost:3128`). This can also be set using the PROXY_URL environment variable.
    --proxy-url https://10.0.0.1:3128
```

The tool will audit all of the repos, and then write a CSV file to the `--output-path` with the results.

### Audit a specific set of repos

`gh migration-audit audit-repos` will audit a specific list of repos specified in a CSV file, and output a CSV file with information about data that cannot be migrated automatically.

To use this command, you'll need to start by preparing your input CSV. It should have exactly two columns, `owner` and `name`. On each row, `owner` should have the name of the user or organization that owns the repo, and `name` should have the name of the repo, e.g.:

```
owner,name
monalisa,octocat
timrogers,gh-migration-audit
```

You can run the command like this:

```bash
gh migration-audit audit-repos \
    # A GitHub access token with the permissions described above. This can also be configured using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
    --access-token GITHUB_TOKEN \
    # The path to a input CSV file with a list of repos to audit. The file should have a header row with the columns `owner` and `name`, followed by a series of rows.
    --input-path input.csv \
    # OPTIONAL: The path to write the audit result CSV to. Defaults to the specified owner followed by the current date and time, e.g. `monalisa_1698925405325.csv`.
    --output-path octocat.csv \
    # OPTIONAL: The base URL of the GitHub API, if you're migrating from a migration source other than GitHub.com.
    --base-url https://github.acme.inc/api/v3
    # OPTIONAL: The URL of an HTTP(S) proxy to use for requests to the GitHub API (e.g. `http://localhost:3128`). This can also be set using the PROXY_URL environment variable.
    --proxy-url https://10.0.0.1:3128
```

The tool will audit all of the repos, and then write a CSV file to the `--output-path` with the results.

## Contributing

### Adding a new auditor

If you identify a piece of data that isn't automatically migrated which isn't detected by this tool, you can write an *auditor* to generate a migration warning. Here's what you need to do:

1. Figure out how to detect the data that can't be migrated using GitHub's REST or GraphQL API
1. If the data is returned on the `Repository` object in the GraphQL API, update the GraphQL query in `src/repositories.ts` to fetch that data, and then update the `GraphqlRepository` type in `src/types.ts` in line with the change
1. Create a TypeScript file in `src/auditors` for your auditor, with a sensible name, copying an existing auditor
1. Update your new auditor to check for unmigratable data and return a warning if there is data which can't be migrated. You may be able to use GraphQL data from step 2, or you can make a fresh API request from your auditor using the `octokit`, `owner` and `repo` passed to the function.
1. Write a unit test for your audiot in `test/auditors`, using an existing one as a template.
1. Update `AUDITORS` in `src/commands/audit-repo.ts`, importing and adding the auditor you created
1. Create a pull request with your changes, including evidence of your functional testing to make sure the auditor works
